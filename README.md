## App Features
- Home page with list of 3 buildings
- User reviews which provide specific insight on the accessibility level of the buildings
-  Tags which make it easier to see what kind of accessibility tools are available at each building

## Approach
**App Design**:
When presented with the problem our team had decided to create a rating system within our app that included a thumbs up/thumbs down option. We also planned to include the percentage of those who rated the building a thumbs up/down in order for users to see what the majority voted. Our team also wanted to implement a tag system which would be put with the description of each building so that users could easily find out whether or not the building was accessible to them. Along with this, we decided that giving users the ability to add comments on all 3 of the buildings to give them a better chance of explaining if they had any issues with the building, giving other users on the app more to base their judgment on whether the building is accessible to them.

**Process & Implementation**:
We then decided what buildings we would focus on in our app. We eventually decided Jacaranda, Education, and Sierra hall. These buildings were chosen because we felt that considering these buildings have multiple floors, elevators, or long distances between rooms, we wanted to focus on these as it may be difficult for some to access them or be able to move within them. Our team decided to split the workload. One person worked on the thumbs up/down system, another took care of the comments system, etc. We worked individually on our own branches, and eventually we commited and pushed in order to connect our work.
